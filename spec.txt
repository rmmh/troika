NanoCorruption:

Goal: A fun-sized machine for more game-like hacking operations.

The machine is a balanced ternary computer operating entirely on trytes.

Trytes range in value from -9841 to 9841.
A tryte is composed of 9 balanced ternary digits, called trits.
Each trit has a value (-1 or T, 0, 1), meaning base conversions look like:

    00010T001 == 1 * 3^5 + (-1) * 3^3 + 1 * 3^0 == 217

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary for more information.

Three trits (a tribble) can be written in balanced septemvigesimal notation
(A..M_N..Z) (alphabet plus space/underscore in the middle: A=-13, _=0, Z=13).
Balanced septemvigesimal is written 0sA_Z, and trinary as #t00010T001.

The memory is 3^9=19683 trytes. All machine state is stored directly in memory.
Registers are stored in memory from 0s__A to 0s__Z.

The machine code is based on tribbles, and aims at being directly human readable.

Examples:
`AXY` means `X = X + Y`
`NB_AAA` means `B = B and 0sAAA`
`SBBNAA` means `B = B - AA`

Addressing:
Some tribbles are reserved to indicate special addressing modes.
  _:     immediate: read next tryte for literal value
  M:     memory: read next tryte for operand location
  O:     offset: read next tryte for for register and 2-tribble offset
      `MAOS_N` means `A = *(S+1)`

else:  operand is a register

2 operand instructions:
A: Add
S: Subtract
M: Move
P: Product (Multiply)
B: Both (And)
Y: anY (Or)

Rab: read memory address b into a
Wab: write value b into memory at a

Stack:

Uab: Push: decrement a, then write value b into memory address a
Oab: Pop: read memory address a into b, then increment a
Cab: Call: Push PC to a, set PC to b

  Ex: CS_ABC ; call routine at #ABC (with stack pointer S)
      OSP    ; return (pop S into Program Counter)

Specials:

Var: set Immediate: set a to the literal value of r
Iar: add Immediate: add the literal value of r to a
   IAN -- add 1 (0sN) to A

TabOOO: General Tritwise binary operator
  Perform tritwise binary operation over the set of trits.
  The following tryte specificies the result of each combination
  of trits, with each trit indicating the result of an operation
  in order:
    Trit 0 = T op T
    Trit 1 = T op 0
    Trit 2 = T op 1
    Trit 3 = 0 op T
    ...
    Trit 8 = 1 op 1

Jumps:
Jrr: Jump relative (Literal value of r, PC += r)
    J_N: skip 1 instruction

Conditional predicates:

Gab: Execute if a>=b
Lab: Execute if a<b
Eab: Execute if a==b
Nab: Execute if a!=b

These skip one tryte, not a full instruction.
  `NAA MAOS_N AAB` executes S_N, not AAB

Reserved registers:
P = Program Counter,
Z = 0s___ (zero), always.

Unused opcodes:
_
D
F
H
K
Q
X
Z
